            <p>Iâ€™m Vijay sandy, but you can just call me Vijay.</p>
            <p>Originally hailing from the India  ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³  for the last decade or so Iâ€™ve been honing my skills in Design <br /> & Developement, 
               production and management roles building products for the web development</p>

               <p>I strive to create elegant solutions that surprise and delight users, while keeping complex technical 
                  dependencies in mind for implementation, scalability and developer sanity.</p>

                  <p>Iâ€™ve worked with 
                  small, agile teams on skunkworks projects and larger development teams with product lifecycles spanning multiple years.</p>

             <p>Depending on the team, resources and deliverables Iâ€™ve worn many hats over the years - holding 
               titles like Product Designer, UX Designer, Front-end Developer, Backend Developer, Growth Lead, 
              </p>

               <p>I also occasionally give talks on design and  development.</p>
